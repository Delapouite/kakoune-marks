# kakoune-marks

[kakoune](http://kakoune.org) plugin to highlight previously saved selections (marks).

## Install

Add `marks.kak` to your autoload dir: `~/.config/kak/autoload/`.

## Usage

Craft some selections and save them in a register. For example `"aZ` to store them
in the `a` register. Move along and do some other stuffâ€¦

Later you need to restore these selections but you have a hard time remembering their
precise locations: use the `:show-marks` command to highlight them.
Use `:hide-marks` when you don't need this extra layer of info anymore.

## Screenshots

Selections being saved in the `a` register.
